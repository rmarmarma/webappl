# webappl

Webappl (no real name was given; webappl is just a placeholder) is a web app that would ideally function like a pseudo networking
space. Users can register for an account where they will share their email address as well as a dream that they hope to accomplish. 
Anyone who visits the site can see who else has joined and what their dreams are, but only those who have signed up and have logged
in can see the given contact information of the other users. 

### Technology involved:
- Spring MVC
- Spring Boot
- Thymeleaf
- Bootstrap & Webjars
- MYSQL
- Spring Security
- Maven


# Running Webappl

Clone the repository using git if you have it installed, or simply download it as a .zip. Since the project utilizes the Spring Boot Maven plugin, once downloaded, you can start the application locally using the following command:

$ mvn spring-boot:run

Alternatively, you can open the project in an IDE, and build and run the project there.
